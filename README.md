# ZOO_Attack_PyTorch
This repository contains the PyTorch implementation of Zeroth Order Black Box Attack (https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.03999) using MNIST and CIFAR10 dataset. This is the exact replica as far possible of the ZOO Attack (https://github.com/IBM/ZOO-Attack) which was implemented in Tensorflow and Keras. The results match almost as same as the paper evaluation results for MNIST and CIFAR10 for both targeted and untargeted attack. Both ZOO_Adam and ZOO_Newton methods of Coordinate Descent were implemented.
